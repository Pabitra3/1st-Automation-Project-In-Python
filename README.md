# Zomato Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Zomato's customer ordering data to gain insights into customer behavior, preferences, and restaurant performance. Our analysis focuses on answering key questions that can help Zomato improve its service and make data-driven business decisions.

## Research Questions

1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
4. What is the average spending on each order for couples who order food online?
5. Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
6. Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those customers with some good offers?

## Data

The analysis is based on the "Zomato data.csv" file. This dataset contains information about restaurant orders, customer preferences, ratings, and more. [You may want to add more specific details about the dataset here, such as the number of records, time period covered, and key variables.]

## Methodology

We use Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment to analyze the data. Our approach includes:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Statistical analysis
4. Data visualization
